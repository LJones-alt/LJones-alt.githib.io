Chemistry laboratory automation demands robust robotic manipulation for safety critical applications where errors can result in chemical spills, equipment damage, or safety hazards. Traditional imitation learning approaches lack failure prediction mechanisms, making them unsuitable for deployment in settings where intervention costs are asymmetric—false negatives (missed failures) are far more costly than false positives (unnecessary interventions).

My research is looking into an uncertainty-aware imitation learning framework that combines ensemble-based epistemic uncertainty estimation with data-driven intervention thresholds.
